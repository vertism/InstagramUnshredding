This is a command line Ruby script that takes a shredded image as input and outputs the original image.
It was written in response to this [Instagram Challenge](http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/12651721845/instagram-engineering-challenge-the-unshredder).

The script takes 2 parameters: the file location, and the width of the shredded strips.
```ruby main.rb Images/tokyo.jpg 32```

N.B. All strips must be the same width
